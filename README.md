[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sugihiru/MALSongs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sugihiru/MALSongs)

This is a project that aims at helping people to track anisongs already downloaded/to download.

# Usage

First, export your MyAnimeList using [this link](https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export) (log in to your account before going to this link). Then, launch src/main with python3 (don't forget to install all dependances using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, open the `File` menu, and click on `Import`. Put the XML that you downloaded from MAL, then click on `Import`. A list of openings and endings from the animes of your MyAnimeList will then appear.
